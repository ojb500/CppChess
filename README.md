CppChess
========

a weak C++ chess engine. Currently for VS2012 on Windows but should be portable eventually. Needs a better name.
 

Goals
=====

Pretty modestly:

1. ~~Have it beat me in a blitz game.~~ Done as of 14/08/2013.
2. Have it beat me in a rapid game.
3. Have it beat me in a classical match.

I am weak so this shouldn't be too hard.
